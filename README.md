# Password-Generator
This assignment focused on the development of JavaScript to allow for the user to enter information and choose their own properties that they would like in their password. 

The section is broken down into 2 major functions: 1. Random Number Generator and 2. Write Password function. The Write Password function holds a variety of conditional statements that compare the user's answers to Booleans and determines which character set to implement based out of these options: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Special Characters. Similarly, a while statement was implemented to ensure that users do not enter numbers outside of the constraints of 8 to 128 characters. 

This project proved to be difficult in the terms of debugging, with getting all elements to align with one another. Upon reflection, the usage of arrays and .join/.split could be a far more useful way to seperate a single variable containing all of the contents, and may be approached more in a future project, or refactoring of this one.
